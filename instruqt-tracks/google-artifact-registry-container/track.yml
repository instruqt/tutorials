title: Storing Container Images in Google Artifact Registry
teaser: Learn how to copy a container image from Docker Hub into Google Artifact Registry
description: |-
  This track shows you how to take an existing container image and push it into a Google Artifact Registry. You can use your own repository to store container images for Instruqt tracks.

  The Instruqt backend runs on Google Cloud Platform. By storing your container images on GCP you can speed startup times and not worry about pull limits imposed by Docker Hub.
